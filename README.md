# 📌 Brewery Finder App (Kotlin + QML Integration)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Qt Quick for Android application** that fetches and displays **brewery information from Ireland**.  
The app identifies the following:
- 📍 **The northernmost brewery**
- 📍 **The southernmost brewery**
- 📍 **The brewery with the longest name**

🚀 **Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Kotlin (Handles API fetching & logic)
- **Frontend:** Hybrid UI (Android XML for some UI + QML for dynamic UI)
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Qt 6.8, Android Studio, CMake, Gradle, Retrofit (for API)

---

## 📌 Background Information
Qt Quick (QML) is **mostly used with C++**, making Kotlin integration rare.  
🔍 When searching online, I found almost no resources explaining how to **connect Kotlin with QML**.  
This project focuses on:
- **Exploring Kotlin-QML interaction** for Android apps.
- **Bridging communication between Kotlin and QML.**
- **Fetching real-time brewery data using APIs instead of local databases.**

## 📌 Creation Process

### **1️⃣ Setting Up the Environment**
- Installed **Qt 6.8**, **Qt for Android Studio Plugin**  
- Configured **Android SDK, NDK, Clang Compiler, and CMake**  
- Set up **Gradle and Qt dependencies** for smooth integration

### **2️⃣ Structuring the Project**
- Created a **Kotlin-based Android project**  
- Added new QT project  
- Configured **Qt Gradle plugin** for compiling QML modules

### **3️⃣ Implementing Features**
#### **🔹 Backend (Kotlin)**
✔ Used **Retrofit + Gson** to fetch brewery data from an API  
✔ Implemented logic to find the **northernmost, southernmost, and longest-name brewery**  
✔ Established **communication bridge between Kotlin and QML**

#### **🔹 Frontend (UI in XML + QML)**
✔ Used **XML layouts** for **Android-native UI elements** (buttons, text)  
✔ Integrated **QML inside Kotlin using `QtQuickView`** for a dynamic UI

## 📌 **Struggles & Learning Experience**

### **💥 Challenges Faced**
**1. Connecting QML and Kotlin**
- No clear tutorials on **QtQuickView with Kotlin** (only C++ examples exist).
- Had to experiment with **QtQuickView, QML modules, and JNI communication**.
- Faced many **missing dependencies and Gradle errors**.

**2. Setting Up the Build System**
- CMake path conflicts → **"Source directory mismatch" errors**
- Qt dependencies not found → **`Qt6Config.cmake` missing issue**
- **NDK, Clang, and C++ errors**, even though the main logic is in Kotlin

**3. Gradle & Dependency Conflicts**
- Initial errors with `QtQuickView` and missing `org.qtproject` packages
- Had to manually add the **correct Gradle version for Qt compatibility**  

## 📌 My Own points

Initially, I thought this would be a simple Kotlin project, but as I started working, I realized that **finding resources for integrating Kotlin and QML together was almost impossible**. Most Qt Quick applications are built using **C++ as the backend**, so trying to do this in Kotlin felt like uncharted territory. I searched on Google, YouTube, and even Qt’s official documentation, but there were **no complete tutorials or guides on how to make this work**.

One of my biggest struggles was **making the Kotlin backend interact with QML**. Unlike C++, where the connection process is well-documented, Kotlin requires extra steps that are not clearly explained anywhere. I had to manually experiment with `QtQuickView`, understand how QML modules are loaded, and deal with Gradle configurations that kept failing. Debugging was especially frustrating because the errors I encountered were **not common** and I had to solve them mostly through trial and error.

Another challenge was configuring **CMake and Gradle** correctly. I ran into multiple issues, like **"Source directory mismatch" errors**, **"Qt6Config.cmake not found"**, and **Android NDK-related errors**. These issues made the build process fail, and I had to carefully fix each one step by step, making sure that the Qt paths were set correctly.

Despite all the struggles, I finally managed to make Kotlin and QML work together, and it was a huge learning experience. I now have a much deeper understanding of **how Qt interacts with Android, how to debug complex build issues, and how QML can be used in a non-C++ environment**. This project was challenging, but overcoming these issues was rewarding.
